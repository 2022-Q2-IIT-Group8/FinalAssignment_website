            <h4>Harrison</h4>
            <p>Assignment 3 was a new challenge in that the project requirements were not as straightforward as our first one. Without the togetherness and adaptivity of our group, we would have struggled to complete this project altogether. While we continuously learn how each other's work styles contribute to the group project, the level of communication is quite high. Delegating tasks where needed and ensuring everyone understands their part in this project is a huge strength of our group. I believe this comes down to clear and effective communication and ongoing support outside of our weekly meetings. </p>
            <p>There are always aspects where one as an individual can improve, or as a group, I think that our team performs tasks at a high level and are efficient in their ways of working. This makes it hard to point out what could be improved. I believe that commitment to actions would be the only place I would seek improvement personally. This goes for showing up to meetings and doing the work that has been allotted efficiently and in a timely manner. Its surprised me how much the group was happy to help out and take on new challenges that were outside their comfort zone. I learnt that our team really does have a wide range of skills and attributes and no one was afraid to give something a go even it was outside of the abilities.
            </p>
            <h4>Ceraph</h4>
            <p>Whilst doing Assignment 3, our group had new approaches and ideas than in Assignment 2. We tried different ways to delegate work and tasks to everyone, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t. Group communication was much better in Assignment 3. It was relatively easy to keep up to track on how everyone was going as the whole group regularly met up on Teams more than what was done in Assignment 2. We did manage to delegate everyone specific tasks to complete and with a due date as to when it was to be completed, which gave everyone a rough idea of what they are supposed to do and by when it is to be completed. This approach made it easier to rely on everyone to make the group project assignment able to be completed in a relatively timely manner and with constant work effort. Sometimes, however, there would be unexplainable times where members don’t show up for meetings or, worse still, not completing what they were expected to do in the expected time frame. This didn’t happen often but was something we can work on. It was also fun to watch how we all could come together as a group and nail down the assignment together in a better time frame and with better efficiency than before. I certainly enjoyed the experience to be working in such a neat group.
            </p>
            <h4>Nat</h4>
            <p>In assignment 3 Our group seemed more structured and had better communication in regards to timelines and understanding of what is needed throughout the assignment. Initially breaking down the rubric to get a thorough appreciation of what is being asked and to know where to delegate. This time around everyone was happy to put their hand up for tasks as well as check to make sure they are doing alright. We still agreed to meet two-three times a week to catch up and ask questions/help. </p>
                <p>There was more confusion around what was being asked compared to 1st and 2nd assignment in the rubric. I find that in assignment three we each took to our strengths and allowed people to take charge. Through this, we were more efficient due to some tasks taking someone 30mins what might have taken someone else 3 hours. With being able to get the work done quicker we were able to review each other's work and comment as well.
                </p>
            <h4>Sky</h4>
            <p>One of the things this group has done fantastically is synergise on tasks. Rather than all members attempting to perform a little of every task, instead we have viewed the project from a big-picture perspective and allocated tasks to those most capable in performing them as effectively as possible. Without this, it would have been impossible to achieve what we have done in such a small time span. This also allowed members to dedicate their focus to specific tasks, rather than having it split between smaller fractions of a wider range of tasks.</p>
            <p>If working on a bigger project, our group has been the ideal model for how you would want each team to function. For smaller projects, I don’t think I could ask for a better group to work with.
                As such, it’s hard to discuss what hasn’t gone well, all I can say is that it appeared some members didn’t realise exactly how much work was required in the first week (or were simply otherwise occupied), and were somewhat absent in the week following the submission of the previous assignment. Nevertheless, shortly after all the members pulled into alignment and have been working like a bat out of hell ever since. What I am most surprised about is the raw synergy of what the group is capable of achieving, both asynchronously and while crunching collectively during meetings. It is a seemingly magical experience to ask someone if they can perform a task, jump elsewhere for a couple minutes to finish something off, and come to find that what you requested is completed, and ready to go
                </p>
                <p>If I’ve learned anything about groups, it’s that with the right team, the level of progress you can achieve in an impossibly short time is simply unbounded.</p>
            <h4>Shampee</h4>
            <p>Effective group work does not happen by accident. It involves deliberate effort, and because there are many people involved,  good note taking, participation and taking initiative is essential. </p>
            <p>Teamwork was definitely one of the most important aspects of our project. We would have been unable to accomplish anything if we had not worked together. Even though the process work was broken up into individual pieces, we often consulted with one another when we ran into difficulties with our work.</p>
            <p>But at the end of the project, we learned from each other's work experiences. During the tenure of working together, situations cropped up and tested us on the scales of making the decisions and handling the pressures and exceptions. </p>
            <p>As a result, we managed to achieve a strong outcome thus enhancing our knowledge and competencies and empowering the group as a whole. 
                </p><br>
            <h1 align="center">Group Reflection </h1>
            <p>The success of any group highly depends on how effective the communication that takes place between the members is. Without effective communication among the members of a given group, it is not possible to achieve its goals and unnecessary conflicts may arise. Group communication was one of the vital lessons learned during our group project. </p>
            <p>At our virtual team meeting, members acted as both an active listener and a contributor to the ongoing project. Although at times, one would take the role of a leader especially when an argument seemed not to lead to any beneficial results, most of the time was spent listening and contributing to the discussion just like other members of the group. The members worked together, listening to each other even when one’s ideas were different from those of others. Everybody had a different part to play, and we coordinate and align our work to contribute our best.
            </p>
            <p>IT systems and applications played a vital role for working together virtually. Like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We circulate documents for comments. The comments are collected and incorporated into the document.</li>
                <li>Meeting agendas and notes ensure nobody misses important information.
                </li>
                <li>Implement project management (eg “who needs to do what by when” within a guidance process).</li>
                <li>Have virtual meetings through Microsoft Team video conferencing.</li>
                <li>Use collective writing through applications, such as Google Docs, that manages versions, allows comments, and tracks changes.
                </li>
                <li>Github helped to put things together to present our work as a collective collaboration.</li>
                <li>Going above and beyond to help explain IT systems in great detail for the future there are a few areas that we can improve on.
                </li>
                <li>Making sure that everyone is supported in their ways of working.
                </li>
                <li>Planning out what tasks are meant to be divided up equally amongst the team.
                </li>
                <li>Preplanning some of our important major meetings.</li>
                <li>Give and receive more feedback on work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Everyone spoke up and everyone acknowledged that there were things we could do better, like invite our quiet contributors to speak, ask for help when we need it, and listen better. 
            </p>
            <p>Working as a group is very much like a high-maintenance machine, everyone has their part to play which is a key in making the “machine” operate. Without each member contributing the group would not operate successfully. Our team was extremely good at picking up on gaps in our work, and filling in when people were unavailable to join meetings.It's surprising to see how much each team member really looks out for everyone.</p>
            <p>Having a different set of skills, made our team unique and successful. We learnt new skills from each other. Our personality tests shows that we all have different personality type. And that lead us to work together without having any personality conflict. Each team member played their role well with due respect to different opinion. Even though we have different personalities, surprisingly we did well as we all share same interest and passion for diving into the world of IT industry.
