            <h4>Topic</h4>
            <p>We want to create a free-of-charge smartphone application that can be used to search for circular economy products, services, and events around the world. It will work as a platform to promote a zero-waste policy by reducing, recycling, reusing, and informing the user about their chosen products. It will include articles about the circular economy. How and where to find products to recycle and reuse. </p>
            <p>Without being aware of food wastage, people throw away food every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. By simply putting the product's name, this app will sort household waste, helping to reduce the fraction of unsorted waste as well as informing the app owner of products and compies carbon footprint so you can purchase ethical products. It will create cooking recipes by adding the ingredients you have. To make food waste prevention fun and easy, users need to open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe. It will help us to use what we have, so nothing goes to waste as well as support other businesses and companies that are ethical when it comes to their carbon footprint and waste management! </p><br>
            <img src="Image/Circular.png" alt="image of circular economy">
            <h4>Motivation </h4>
            <p>With the thoughts of how we can stop or reduce the creation of waste and developing a sustainable world, we wanted to create this app that will help the user to understand how a circular economy works, how important it is to save our environment, and how we can reduce our waste by reusing products, creating new recipes, and educating people so they are able to make ethical choices with their everyday product. This app will be for globally aware citizens who cares about the sustainable world!</p>
            <p>As the Circular Economy can be a complex system requiring a broad number of players in the economy to implement it, the focus is relating to waste only. </p><br>
            <h4>Landscape </h4>
            <p> In our research, we found a few apps related to waste management , food recipes, green and sustainable product finder. 
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://appadvice.com/app/sustain-me/1022256236">Sustain Me:</a>Their ideas are similar to ours except theirs lack a map feature to find nearby recycle shops. 
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://recipme.app/">recipME: </a>This app rates the sustainability of each recipe but doesn't have the recipe calculator like our app.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://gozerowaste.app/en/ ">Go Zero Waste:</a>Quite similar to our app but it doesn’t have the options for recipe from available 
                ingredients and a waste classification system.                  
            </p>
            <p>As a point of difference, our full app offerings will feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Push notifications</li>
                <li>Community wall</li>
                <li>Surveys and questionnaires</li>
                <li>Video, image, and audio hubs</li>
                <li>Image Recognition technology</li>
                <li>Maps to find nearby recycle shops</li>
                <li>Calendar integrations</li>
                <li>Ecommerce carts</li>
                <li>Menu system</li>
                <li>Event page</li>
                <li>Selecting products and Bins</li>
                <li>Bin Quiz</li>
                <li>User directory</li>
                <li>User Feedback</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What will make our app standout is to have a quiz section where users will earn reward points after answering questions about waste and the circular economy. With the rewards, they will be able to purchase green products from selected store. </p>
            <p>In addition, the purpose of the reward system is to enable the users to see how green they are and this will further facilitate change as they make more informed choices for ethical and sustainable products at their local grocery store. 
            </p>
            <p>However, in terms of project timeline feasibility, the development of the app will have a tab for recipes from available ingredients, a tab for both list and map view to find nearby recycling points for various types of garbage, as well as waste classification system with a reminder to tell user which days they need to put bins out the night before. </p>
