            <p>I am Shampee and my roots are from Bangladesh, a land of rivers, and now living in the Greater Sydney
                area of NSW for more than 10 years. My favorite hobbies are dancing, graphic arts and watching art films
                including anime. At TAFE (technical and further education) Hornsby, I completed a Diploma in Website
                Development. While doing the course, I found it quite remarkable and interesting how we were able to
                employ creativity in technology with the help of some codes and weird languages. I am planning to
                complete the Bachelor of Information Technology program at RMIT to hone my skills and further explore
                the industry as a full-stack Web Developer.</p>

            <p>I am from Lismore, NSW. I got my first degree from southern cross university and have been a physical
                therapist since 2014. I reside in Hervey Bay QLD, where I started a physical therapy clinic with my best
                friend in 2018. I like surfing and snowboarding and have a two-year-old black labrador named Soda. My
                interest in I.T is due to the problem-solving component and the ever-changing landscape as technology
                grows. Currently have no experience in the field apart from troubleshooting and using cloud-based
                storage programs for work. </p>

            <p>I am 17 years old, and I live in Perth, WA. I am currently undergoing this Introduction to IT course as
                well as the Introduction to Programming course at RMIT. I really like programming and am enjoying
                learning Python as well as casual programming on Scratch (with Scratch blocks) and Khan Academy (with
                JavaScript and HTML). I usually like to compose songs on the piano or on a music software called FL
                Studio in my free time. I also solve Rubik’s cubes and other similar puzzles (2x2, 4x4, Pyraminx, Skewb,
                and Square-1). My fastest time for solving a Rubik’s cube is 7.22 seconds and I can solve it anytime
                within 20 seconds.</p>

            <p>I was born in Melbourne in 1998. My family background is Austrian and Italian. In 2016, I graduated from
                Wesley College and obtained my VCE. I have a Certificate II in Electrotechnology. I speak fluent English
                but would love to learn another language one day. I have a 6-month-old puppy named Loki. He is an
                American Staffy Cross, and we rescued him from the pound in February of this year. I am not sure Loki
                was the most appropriate name for him as Loki is the “god of mischief”. Consequently, he is always up to
                no good.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Sky, I have a background in software development for mobile and embedded platforms, and an interest in tinkering, and trying to improve people’s lives in areas they may not even recognise they have an issue, questioning every action, no matter how mundane, and asking if there is a way to avoid needing to do such things at all.
Outside of the creative, my hobbies range from modern architecture to automotive design; you will be hard-pressed to find an interest of mine that doesn’t fall somewhere under the banner of “industrial design”, although I’ll be damned if I can think of a nicer way to wake up in the morning than from my puppy nudging me out of bed as my local magpies sing at my door, asking for their daily mealworms.  
</p><br>

            <h1 align="center">Group Processes</h1><br>
            <p>For Assignment 2, our group worked alright. Out of a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 meaning horribly and without communication, to 10 meaning excellent, court-case-professionalism, We would rate out group work as a 5. While some of us have worked in-industry, for the majority this was one of our first subjects at university, and as such, team dynamics weren’t anywhere near as effective as they could be.
            </p>
            <p>Our group consists of five members. We meet virtually twice a week through Microsoft Teams. Also we maintained continuous communications through Teams chat as well as task submission and review using Google Drive.
                The first challenge we faced after assignment A2 was how to organise the work to complete the task on time.  
                </p>
                <p>This time we divided the task into smaller pieces and assigned these parts to each team member. We developed a time frame to complete the task on time. Now all team members know who will do what, in what format, and by when. By this approach, we hope to improve our group work a lot and will do some creative modifications as well.
                    In this case, even if some members do not complete the tasks they have volunteered for, it will be easier to identify and rectify the problem at hand.
                    </p><br>

            <h1 align="center">Career Plans</h1><br>
            <h4>Shampee Barua</h4>
            <p>My ideal job is to work as a Full Stack/Web Developer. According to "labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies)" Mar.  01, 2017  - Feb.  28, 2018, Web Developer ranked sixth highest on demand of 5990 IT jobs positions then followed by Graphic Designer/Desktop Publisher on demand of 5162 positions. Javascript is the second highest ranking IT skills, then followed by Java, graphic design, website production.
            </p>
            <p>After analysing the data provided, I am still interested in a career as a Full Stack/Web Developer. This is because Javascript ranked higher IT skills and from further research on Seek, found there are  4014 Web Developer jobs as of till date. This indicated to me that the industry has a high need for the position of Full Stack/Web Developer.
                I am confident that after completing this course I will gain the required knowledge in programming like python, Java etc. and learn to work in a team environment as well as to further enhance my verbal and communication skills whilst producing the project deliverables.
                </p>
            
                <h4>Ceraph Toh</h4>
                <p>My current career plan for IT would still lie in Casual Desktop Support. This role requires the ability to understand customer’s problems and be able to communicate well with them what they want completed (like this group work is meant to be). Casual Desktop Support is a role in which experience in troubleshooting problems with Desktop systems and similar hardware for an organisation. This job is usually consulted when there is a need to fix a system when it breaks, so it doesn’t exactly have a “set schedule” as with other jobs. Sometimes Desktop support will be consulted to fix other systems like networks, phones, or printers. Desktop support would be an on-site job.The hard-skills of the job would be to have extensive experience with desktop hardware, software applications, operating systems, and network connections. The soft-skills of the job would be to have good communication abilities, and to have a passion for the industry. Among all of our groups’ ideal jobs, probably the only similarity between the jobs is the fact that they require programming knowledge, as it is the language of computers. Each role is different in that Web Developers use the programming language of text for use on webpages. Casual Desktop support would need extensive knowledge on different ways to approach a problem, which could be programming or hardware related. Networking Engineer is more into monitoring and maintaining computer networks. Software Developers have more relevance in the creation of different types of softwares, and Senior mobile platforms engineer is a specialist role into mobile software.
                </p>
                <h4>Harrison Mori</h4>
                <p>​​My ideal job as a senior software developer has not changed after reviewing the data by Burning Glass Technologies, it has given me a clear understanding on what skills are required in the industry sector. The group consist of like-minded people that all want jobs in similar areas of IT, examples are that Shampee is interested as a “Full stack/Web developer” which uses of python and Java. These languages are used in my role as well, the difference being how the languages are used and carried out. Across our group there is a trend to understand certain programming languages. Some of the programming languages re used across different rolls, and some are more job specific. Communication is a skill that is needed across all of the jobs listed by our team and is one of the most requested skill in job descriptions. Some of the positions we have chosen are more team management based like my roll, and some are more skilled focused rolls.
                </p>
                <h4>Nat Sloane</h4>
                <p>The group's ideal jobs range from Senior Software Developer,  Full Stack Developer, Casual Desktop Support,  Senior software engineer and Network Engineer. Between these five different career paths, there are prevalent traits in them. Each has requirements in coding languages from beginner to advanced. There are differences between levels of experience and more senior/specialised roles e.g. Senior Engineer/Networking these positions require either more years of experience or tertiary education. 
                </p>
                <p>It is interesting that the more junior-level jobs and career paths have very similar traits and requirements which allows individuals to dip their toes into various aspects of It. This way they can be more informed and understand what is required when or if they want to specialise. I am still currently interested in network engineering due to its ever-changing landscape and problem-solving. There seems to still be a high need for Network engineers though I feel the best way for me to approach this field is to do a boot camp course in python etc and then hopefully get into a master's course in Network engineering. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Sky Velleity</h4>
                <p>While the pathway is anything but set in stone, my current trajectory is aimed at remaining an individual contributor, and rising to the level of senior engineer, in mobile development for Apple’s family of operating systems. </p>
                <p>While further experience is required for this, I would like to spread it both working in established, legacy businesses, then take that experience into a startup. Life tends to have a way of throwing curve balls at you, so I’m always on the lookout for exciting opportunities in my field, working on fresh problems that are yet to be solved, and the right opportunity at the right place can make all the difference in the world.
                </p>
                <p>While anyone who knows binary can count the number of current listings for iOS developer rolls on seek with one hand, most of the listings at the time of writing are near or above double six figures. That tends to make what opportunities are available a little more compelling.
