            <h4>The git repository, hosted on GitHub, for the above website:</h4>
           <p><a href="https://github.com/2022-Q2-IIT-Group8/FinalAssignment_website">https://github.com/2022-Q2-IIT-Group8/FinalAssignment_website
        </a></p>
        <h4>The git repository, hosted on GitHub, for the codebase of the app our group has built:
        </h4>
           <p><a href="https://github.com/2022-Q2-IIT-Group8/CarteBlanche">https://github.com/2022-Q2-IIT-Group8/CarteBlanche</a></p>
            <p>The team has collaborated on all codebases using the git version management system, and has hosted their repositories on github. As linked earlier, the group has a repository for the project’s <a href="https://github.com/2022-Q2-IIT-Group8/FinalAssignment_website">publicly facing website</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/2022-Q2-IIT-Group8/CarteBlanche">codebase for the prototype app</a>.
            </p>
            <p>While the activity logs are undoubtedly a direct, literal reflection on the code contributions to the project, they do not paint an accurate picture of the total work contributed to the project.
                The most obvious example is that of the website, as most of its contents were first written collaboratively as rich text using Google Docs, then later copied wholesale into webpages, with the rich text formatting replaced with HTML markup. Many people could contribute to a section, spending countless hours writing, editing, revising, and discussing the best way to present some information, only for that to be represented by a member who didn’t contribute at all to that section, other than adding in the formatting for the html. In this case, the git contribution is not at all representative of the actual work performed.
                </p>
                <p>Another example is for the app prototype, as all of the planning, mockups, wireframing, concept art, discussion, and even direct development happened in Microsoft Teams and Google Docs. Even many of the prototypes built live during collaborative meetings were only done to demonstrate concepts, and this code was immediately reverted afterwards. None of this is expressed in the git commit history or GitHub activity log. That isn’t to say this work is intangible, as it has resulted in innumerable design artefacts, presented elsewhere, however these were unsuitable and impracticable for creation on github.
                </p>
                <p>And none of this is to mention all the elements of the project which didn’t even touch github, such as writing a script for the presentation video, then filming, producing, dubbing, editing, and publishing the video.</p>
                <p>If the entire team simply dedicated all their time to writing software, then the git commit history would be more indicative of the work performed, however this project is greater in scope than a simple software platform, as such, github activity alone is insufficient to judge the level of work contributed.</p>
