            <p>Should the team wish to bring in external talent to further progress with the project, the four most pertinent roles would be as follows:</p>
            <h4>Project Manager</h4>
            <p>Although members of the team have various development experience, their group management experience is limited, and as such, bringing in an external party capable of maintaining a big-picture view of the team, allowing individual members to focus on tasks that their respective skillsets lend themselves well to, would greatly increase productivity, and reduce overhead.
            </p>
            <h4>Intern</h4>
            <p>Although there is still a significant amount of technical work that needs to be performed, on a limited budget, it is a waste to spend valuable developer resources performing menial tasks such as data aggregation and processing. As such, delegating these tasks to an intern would further free up team members to focus on their respective skillsets without needing to worry about essentials getting done.
            </p>
            <h4>Mobile Application Developer</h4>
            <p>Although the team is capable of picking up skills at a rapid pace as required, reskilling existing team members into app developers would be a waste of otherwise valuable resources, it is instead much more efficient to bring in external Individual Contributors who can hit the ground running, as well as bring their insight and experience to the team.
            </p>
            <h4>Graphic and Interface Designer</h4>
            <p>The team has done a fantastic job so far of creating mockups, and turning those mockups into a reality, however to go from functional to truly appealing lies in the realm of a Graphic Designer, and as such, bringing one in to further the project would serve as an invaluable resource. Not only could they provide their skills relating to advice on interface design and user experience, they could also create assets for app and web graphics, advertisements, and other promotional resources.
