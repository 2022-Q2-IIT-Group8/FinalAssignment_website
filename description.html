            <h4>Aims</h4>
            <p>Our overall aim is to create, deliver and roll out a free-of-charge smartphone application that can be used to search for circular economy products, services, and events around the world which aims to promote a zero-waste policy and inform the user of benefits, facts and information to help save our planet,
            </p>
            <p>Our first goal is to design the app. Figure out what it will look like, and how the user will interact with the system and what type of design it will display. Within this goal, we have sub-goals, which will need to be met. Some of these are implementing these key features such as push notifications, a Community wall, A map showing different types of recycling centres and what can be recycled, a menu system, and User Feedback. This goal is important as it is the backbone of what we want to create and develop. Without this app, there is only an idea but no action.
            </p>
            <p>Another goal is thorough testing and refinement of user interaction.
                While simply having the app satisfy all functional requirements is a priority, that in and of itself is insufficient to create a truly compelling experience for our users. We want to make sure that the time and number of interface interactions needed to progress through a user story is as efficient as possible, and we hope to achieve this through testing, both internally and externally, while we take in feedback on areas of the app people feel are taking longer than they should, and investigate possible optimisations.
                </p>
                <p>Another goal is to inform users on the circular economy and how to help save our environment, breaking down big-picture issues into easily manageable tasks they can integrate into their day-to-day life. </p>
                <p>Users should not feel that the use of this app, or the advice it suggests, is in any way a burden, but is instead something which makes their life easier, simplifying things that would otherwise simply get in their way.
                </p><br>

                <h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
                <p>Following our previous assignment, the team has jumped head first into building the app, as well as creating an online presence around the app in the form of a website. The following details how we have achieved this so far, and how we plan to continue the project in the future:
                </p>
                <p>First, we decided to create a software platform that would help as many people as possible to reduce their environmental impact with as little prior experience and knowledge in the field as possible.</p>
                <p>The initial scope for this project was incredibly vast, Seemingly unbound in ambition.
                    The original proposal was to create an app using “Hybrid App Development” techniques, Building the entire app using multi platform libraries and frameworks, in order to target as many platforms as possible.
                    </p>
                <p>In addition to targeting a wide range of platforms, the Apple is to include any and every feature trained up by the development team, such as having local knowledge ofEnvironmental resources and services, and calendar to keep track of which day is your bin needs to be taken out, and AI enhanced object recognition and categorisation cross-referencing a database Of every product and barcode domestically available, as well as that products recyclability and re-use information, leveraging AI to detect which of a set of known product varieties sharing a given barcode the user currently has, Paula, in the event that such things aren't available, making an educated guess as to the most likely material constitution of the product, and therefore, how best to recycle or re-purpose it.
                </p>
                <p>However, given the total timeframe of six weeks to go from having nothing more than abstract concepts and flow charts, and create a functional prototype to allow the app to be demonstrated, more realistic scope was required.</p>
                <p>As such, the first step for the team was to decide what is an is not a critical demonstrable feature for the prototype to have.
                </p>
                <p>This does not necessarily align withDesired features in the MVP, or a national release of the app, as this prototypeHas been built not for use by consumers, but to demonstrate most effectively the potential this app has.
                </p>
                <p>As such, a collection of features best capable of demonstrating the intended purpose of the app were chosen.
                    These can best be seen demonstrated in the presentation video, however I will still go through them here.
                    </p>
                <p>The first, “Ingredients to Recipe Finder” (name not final) is a tool used to find great tasting, healthy recipes that can either be made supplementally, or entirely, with ingredients the user has available to them. The current user story requires first that the user add their available ingredients to a list,Then a list of recipes containing these ingredients will be presented in an additional view.</p>
                <p>While the current interface seems suboptimal, as it uses a single screen to switch between various subviews, rather than dynamically transitioning from view to view, it is still able to demonstrate the features of the software, and as such, improving the UX has been delegated to post-prototype production.
                </p>
                <p>The next feature selected to showcase the app’s functionality was a “Recycling Map”, a collection of use which would allow the user to first select the types of refuse they have, and then be presented with a view showing which local recycling and reuse facilities are capable of accepting all or some of their selected waste. It would also provide a list of all entered waste, allowing the user to quickly check what they have entered prior to departing to recycle their items, to help make sure they don’t forget anything.</p>
                <p>The third feature selected was a council bin calendar, which would alert the user when their next bin pickup date was, and help them keep track of which bins are due on what day.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, the last feature selected was one which allows the user to submit feedback directly to the developer from within the app, to allow the team to better improve the app as they went on.</p>
                <p>Although most group members were in agreement through ad-hoc discussions regarding this, in order to ensure consensus, a short video was produced, in lieu of a live presentation, first displayed during the Sunday meeting to all members who were present, but also hosted as a video that could be viewed asynchronously by team members.
                </p>
                <p>The video is available on the <a href="https://2022-q2-iit-group8.github.io/FinalAssignment_website/Presentation_mini.mp4" target="_blank">Project's Website</a>, where it can be viewed or downloaded.
                    Portions of the script of this video were re-used to create the final presentation, primarily while talking about the mechanics and design of the app. At this stage, a living design document was created, allowing group members to collectively contribute to the project’s direction. Nothing in this document was set in stone, and it was designed to be changed along with the scope and development of the project itself. An archived copy of the document can be found hosted on the <a href="https://2022-q2-iit-group8.github.io/FinalAssignment_website/Design%20Document.pdf" target="_blank">Project's Website</a>.
                    </p>
                <p>It was also suggested that, rather than expending additional developer efforts to target as many platforms as possible, that, at very least for the prototype, it would be wise to only target a single, native platform, preferably one with a high market-share, to significantly reduce required development workload. As such, the iOS platform was chosen, as the group’s research found it has a 57% market share in Australia, and the team already had members familiar with the tools required for development.
                </p>
                <p>In order to ensure that, should the group later decide to re-write the app using hybrid frameworks, either for wider outreach within Australia using a shared, uniform design language, or for a global release where iOS is not the dominant platform, manu views within the application were planned to be written using HTML and javascript, allowing for them to be seamlessly transplanted into a hybrid app.
                </p>
                <p>Due to the severely constrained development cycle of this application, the lead developer began work on it almost immediately after the group agreed that a native app should be used for the prototype, long before some of the finer details were even discussed by the team, such as the name.
                </p>
                <p>As such, many placeholders were used during development, the most notable of which for the name. Originally, as the lead developer was given Carte blanche, a blank cheque if you will, to proceed with development in any way they saw fit, before storyboards, interface mockups, and user stories were created, they selected the application name “CarteBlanche” for the project, as, while not final, such things are required to begin development.
                </p>
                <p>While the name has been changed in all user-facing areas of the app to the more succinct “Gomi”, the romaji representation of the Japanese word ゴミ, translated to english as “Garbage” or “Trash” (potentially still a placeholder, but in use throughout the prototype stage”, the internal name “CarteBlanche” is still visible to developers, as both the project name in Xcode, the name of the git repository the project files are hosted in, and in the app’s bundle identifier, com.skyvelleity.CarteBlanche.</p>
                <p>It is worth noting that, should the text “CarteBlanche” be displayed to the user at any point, this is considered a bug and needs to be redressed. The use of programmatic identification throughout the software, rather than hardcoding in titles, should reduce the number of areas names need to be updated in the future, should the group choose, or be compelled by investors, to change the name of the product again.
                </p>
                <p>Parallel to development, team members began researching similar products and apps, drawing inspiration from what else is available, identifying opportunities to create user stories more optimised and beneficial than any current product on the market has been able to offer.
                    Such details were discussed in great length during team meetings, and changes were made on the fly to the app, presented live during meetings, to further refine the app design in a collective manner. While not strictly following any software methodology, the group almost inadvertently implemented an Agile framework for development, with a major weekly meeting every Sunday with the ongoing progress presented, tasks for the week delegated to group members, and development focus discussed for the week to come. Progress was then reviewed during the weekly Wednesday meetings, making sure everyone was on-track, however these were more often than not used as a collaborative session to work on any required documents and assignments together.
                    </p>
                <p>As such, while not intentionally, the team has adopted a methodology rather similar to Scrum project management methodology, and although not perfect, has served the team well, as everyone has been aware of what needs to be done, how the team is going, what goals may need to be changed in scope, and if time needs to be reallocated to serve more pertinent interests.</p>
                <p>Development continued rapidly, with all planned features implemented, albeit roughly, within the first week of development. As further feedback and research was submitted, the wireframe and design mockups were revised, members suggested entirely new ways of presenting information to the user, and the development team updated the app to suit these requests.</p>
                <p>In the final weeks of the prototype, focus shifted from the app itself to how it would be presented. Elements of the app required by the script, although not yet implemented to a functional level, were instead mocked up using a spoofed backend, to allow for shots of the app in use to use real footage, rather than simulated screens, or at very least screen recordings of the app in use, rather than needing to mock up footage using other design tools. Once the script was finalised, filming began, and with development devices on hand, to allow for rapid deployment of the app on-set to suit the needs of the videographer.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, going forwards, there are a number of choices as to how the team can proceed.
                    The first is to simply continue building the app as-is, as a native iOS app using the Xcode development toolkit, and aim to publish on the App Store.
                    </p>
                <p>The other, should an iOS developer no longer be available, is to rebuild the app using a multiplatform framework, possibly as a Hybrid App, using native frameworks tightly coupled with web elements. As some of the views in the app are already web-based, they could be brought over with little effort, however the remainder of the application would need to be rewritten.
                </p>
                <p>Ultimately the decision would need to be made based on human and financial resources, as well as target  geodemographics. First launching in Australia make the first option the most viable, however globally the app may see limited reach, especially in countries most affected by climate change and pollution.
                </p>
                <h4>Roles</h4>
                <p>While no roles have been formerly specified, various emergent roles have arisen from the tasks team members have taken on themselves.
                </p>
                <p>Shampee, having been the one who conceptualised the idea, has taken on the role of Project Owner, giving direction to the group, and being the cornerstone of the project, as well as having worked quite a great deal on the website, as well as the presentation video.
                </p>
                <p>Ceraph, having done extensive research into similar projects, has taken on the role of a Product Manager, being able to provide big-picture insights into the project as a whole, as well as direction on how best to implement various features.
                </p>
                <p>Harrison has taken the role of creative director for the project, creating numerous design mockups, as well as providing the most realtime feedback during meetings on how the app should look and behave, allowing for greatly increased development speed. Harrison has also contributed to the presentation.
                </p>
                <p>Nat has taken the role of an Individual Contributor, working on whatever areas of the project require the most attention.</p>
                <p>Sky has taken the role of Lead Developer, working on the core logic for the app, and integrating resources created by other team members into the software.
                </p>
                <p>Although no roles have been predetermined, the flexibility this has granted us has done nothing but work in our favour, as anyone was free to jump on any component of the project they desired.</p><br>
                <h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
                <p>The current Scope of GOMI is to launch it with its most appealing feature for the user. The Maps feature helps allow the user to find nearby recycle shops. The calendar system reminds users when to put out their rubbish bins and what bin is due as well this app can be manually inputted by the user. As well as selecting products and Bins feature which helps the user decide where certain items of rubbish need to go which can be allocated due to most items having specific symbols due to what they are made off. 
                </p>
                <p>Utilising these features in the beginning will allow the user to interact with the app and also have alerts and reminders which will allow the app to continually be seen while the other features are developed in the later stages. As they progress with the app users will strive for being greener which will go hand in hand with making more informed decisions that they will learn from the app with updated news and information.</p><br>

                <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
                <p>We created a wireframe using sketchbook app for a rough layout of our mobile app. The purpose of the wireframe is to simply illustrate the app’s features and lay out the schemes. 
                    Then we created the overall style of the app, including things like the colour scheme, font selection, and buttons and widgets. Design encompasses the user interface (UI) and the user experience (UX). For distribution, we plan to build the initial MVP using hybrid app development, to streamline development efforts. Most hybrid builds rely on Javascript. This coding language will help to create the app once and deploy it on multiple platforms like iOS and Android. The flexibility of a hybrid app is still high in terms of what the app can accomplish. While we will not need a developer who specialises in low-level coding to build it, they still need to have web development skills. 
                    </p>
            <img src="Image/app wireframe.jpg" alt="image of wireframe">
                <p>Utilising technology such as Vuforia Cloud Recognition we will be able to recognise and track millions of images for products that customers will upload to their own personal profiles. As well as using cloud-based data storage from Amazon web service which is great for start-ups due to its auto-scaling ability so it limits the chances of the platform crashing. </p>
                <p>The group primarily collaborated through Microsoft Teams as well as Google Docs.
                    For various documents, such as the design document for the project (available in archived form on the <a href="https://2022-q2-iit-group8.github.io/FinalAssignment_website/Design%20Document.pdf" target="_blank">Project's Website</a>), the script used to produce the demonstration video, meeting agendas, the document was created on Google Docs, allowing all members to synchronously or asynchronously (depending on their preferred work style) collaborate and edit the document, as well as leave comments and communicate to other team members. Google Docs is accessible as a webapp, as well as through standalone native apps for a wide range of platforms, as such it is accessible to anyone who is otherwise capable of running Microsoft Teams, which was an externally imposed prerequisite for the group.
                    </p>
                <p>The prototype was built using Apple Xcode, using the Swift programming language, as well as the SwiftUI declarative user interface toolkit.
                    In order to achieve a demonstrable software example in the limited timeframe available, Sky’s previous experience with these tools and technologies was leveraged, resulting in a functional prototype that included all of the essential features of the app in the very first week of development, which they proceeded to build on and iterate on throughout the remainder of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>While it is possible to edit Swift and SwiftUI code on any platform, it is best to leverage an IDE such as Xcode for the task at hand.<br>
                        Xcode can either be run in a macOS virtual machine on x86 or ARM64 hardware platforms, or natively on a machine running the Apple macOS operating system.<br>
                        As the prototype is targeting iOS versions 14.5 and higher, a copy of macOS 11.0 or newer will be required to run the minimum supported version of Xcode (12.5.1). To run this natively, a Macintosh built within the last 8 years, or a compatible virtualisation platform, will be required.
                        Although older machines may take longer to compile the software, there is no reason they wouldn’t be able to build the project.<br>
                        While the swift language is open source, and can run on a wide range of platforms, the prototype app is tightly coupled to Cocoa Touch and the system frameworks for the iOS platform, and therefore running on anything but the intended target platform would yield little purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to native code, the app integrates a range of HTML views, serving internally bundled .html files in order to display richly formatted text to the user. These views can be directly reused once the app is re-written as a hybrid app, and as all group members are familiar with the HTML language, everyone is able to directly contribute to the app’s interface as they see fit.
                        </p> <br>
                        <h4>Testing</h4>
                        <p>Testing will primarily fall into two categories, the first, being software testing, to verify the application performs the way it is expected to, and the second being UX testing, to optimise the way users interact with the software.
                            The first will be achieved through a combination of automated and manual testing.<br>
                            Automated testing will be performed by writing a series of integration tests into the app, using the XCTest framework, and these tests will be performed as integrations every time a commit is made to the project’s repository, ensuring that no regressions enter the codebase, and that the app functions as designed.<br>
                            Manual testing will be performed by distributing the app to internal group members using the TestFlight platform, and later, once the app has become more refined, a public TestFlight launch can be performed, allowing members of the general public to enrol in testing of the app. For the time being, though, until the app has gone through review, only internal members of the team will be able to run the app.
                            All crash data will be sent back to the developer console, where crash data can be triaged, and bugs can be fixed. In addition, other issues that do not result in a crash, but do impact user experience, are also reported, such as app launch time.<br>
                            Users are able to submit screenshots and feedback directly through TestFlight, allowing for suggestions and errors to be reviewed.<br>
                            Further testing is required to ensure that users have the best experience with the app possible, by showing the app to a diverse range of parties, and consulting them for their feedback. Even if they do not have solutions, oftentimes people can articulate their opinion on something, and these opinions are invaluable, both in improving the app itself, and also in changing the product story presented to people, allowing them to better understand the purpose of the app before they even see it.
                            Oftentimes, a user may think ill of a product not because it isn’t working optimally, or as intended, but because they simply misunderstand what the purpose of the product is in the first place. This is a problem for the design team, not the user, to solve, and reachout can help identify these issues early.
                            </p><br>

                        <h4>Risks </h4>
                        <p>With Gomi the risks can range from issues stemming from the SwiftUI framework still being a relatively immature, leading to time being sunk into correcting bugs with the framework, rather than the project’s own software. In addition, the framework is quite young and has constant updates, this can cause an otherwise working piece of software to fail in unpredictable ways when a user updates their device. Due to this, a relatively small, albeit growing, talent pool of developers currently uses SwiftUI. Luckily for us, Sky is already very competent with this platform. Also mentioned above, SwiftUI lacks support with earlier iOS versions, although only 7% of currently active iOS devices run a version of iOS prior to iOS 14, and a significant portion of those devices would be able to update to a compatible operating system should they so choose.<br>
                            Apart from the Software, Launching and keeping this application alive will have its own problems which have been documented with previous and similar apps. ‘Sustain Me’ is probably the most similar App that launched back in 2016 and showed plenty of promise in Victoria. Their main issue that would be their undoing was the progress of technology and updated platforms. They either had to sink or swim by either rebuilding the app for the new market with cross-platform support, modern AI and chatbot integration to reduce the need for human labour, as well as attract a larger market.

                        <h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
                        <p>In Assignment 3, our group communication was a vital part for us to successfully complete this assignment. We all agreed to communicate via Microsoft Teams and, occasionally, Outlook for emailing members for reminders. We agreed to continue our regular meeting times, via Microsoft Teams, from Assignment 2, which was on Wednesdays and Sundays from 18:00 to 18:30 AEST. These meetings provided us vital group communication and we were able to share project ideas and delegate tasks to each member. In the case that we cannot reach out to particular members over Teams or have to ask someone to complete a task, we would tend to use Outlook to email members about problems. <br> 

                            Although the team did delegate tasks to certain members, we remained flexible, reviewing our progress twice a week, and reallocating tasks from members who had overallocated themselves, ensuring that we hit all our targets withing the given timeframe.
                            If there was anything we could have optimised, should we do this again, it would have been more aggressive reallocation of tasks, to increase project velocity.
